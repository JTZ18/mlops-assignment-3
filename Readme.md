# MLOps Assignment 3

This repository contains the code for MLOps Assignment 3.

## Setup

To set up the project, you need to run the `setup.sh` script. This script will download the necessary `data`, `faiss_index`, and `cache` folders for you and place them into the repository. This will speed up your workflow as you won't have to chunk and embed the data which is time consuming on the edu cluster.

To run the script, open a terminal in the repository directory and type:

```bash
./setup.sh
```

This will start the download and extraction process. Once the script finishes running, you should see the data, faiss_index, and cache folders in your repository directory.

## Usage
After running the setup script, you can start working on the assignment. Make sure to follow the instructions in the assignment description.
